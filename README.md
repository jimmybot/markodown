# markodown
A static-site generator based on Marko and Markdown

Not much here yet but here's what I'd eventually like to see built.

1. Start with a minimally-useful core: static compilation + rendering of Marko templates.  Because of Marko's beautiful, minimal concise syntax, you get both easier to read+write html as well as reusability from using a template language vs raw html.

2. Add support for markdown or else change the name of this project :-D

3. Add support for sibling Sass indented syntax

4. Simple internal-linking system

5. Pie-in-the-sky advanced features:
- Really nice performance either via some mix of background pre-loading / isomorphic rendering
- Support blog-friendly features such as Atom feeds, sitemaps, simple search, date structure, categories, etc
